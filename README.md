# Rcirc
Rcirc helps to identify the coding ability of circRNA and visualize the feature at various aspects. Rcirc provides general visualization for both single circRNA and meta-feature of thousands of circRNAs, Rcirc was designed as a user-friendly tool which covers lots of high automatically functions without running many complicated processes by user. 

## Introduction
The main goal of our study was to develop a user-friendly tool which covers the main demands for circRNA research. Rcirc is a capable and user-friendly package based on R language. The package provides numerous analyses for both upstream and downstream research include circRNA detection, coding ability identification, single feature analyses and visualization of meta-feature. Furthermore, the users can visualize the reads mapping situation for each junction site of circRNA by Rcirc with sequencing data. With growing attention on circRNA, Rcirc will become an auxiliary tool to encourage researchers to proceed with further analyses in circRNA world. All the detail of usage is included by the documents of Rcirc in GitHub's online pages.
