R language based circRNA visualization toolbox
## Introduction
With the deepening of research on circRNA, Facing the data of many circRNAs, the analysis and processing of data is very important. We developed the circviewer to help visualize and correlate all types of circRNA data.This includes the distribution of circRNA and its association with genomically related features such as GC content.
